"Tensors (:ref:`scalar_tensor`) can be *placed* in a specific shape and "
"*layout*. Defining a proper layout can be critical to performance, "
"especially for memory-bound applications. A carefully designed data "
"layout can significantly improve cache/TLB-hit rates and cacheline "
"utilization. Although when performance is not the first priority, you "
"probably don't have to worry about it."

"In Taichi, the layout is defined in a recursive manner. See :ref:`snode` "
"for more details about how this works. We suggest starting with the "
"default layout specification (simply by specifying ``shape`` when "
"creating tensors using ``ti.var/Vector/Matrix``), and then migrate to "
"more advanced layouts using the ``ti.root.X`` syntax if necessary."
