"**Can a user iterate over irregular topology instead of grids, such as "
"tetrahedra meshes, line segment vertices?** These structures have to be "
"represented using 1D arrays in Taichi. You can still iterate over it "
"using `for i in x` or `for i in range(n)`. However, at compile time, "
"there's little the Taichi compiler can do for you to optimize it. You can"
" still tweak the data layout to get different run time cache behaviors "
"and performance numbers."

"**Can potential energies be differentiated automatically to get forces?**"
" Yes. Taichi supports automatic differentiation. We do have an `example "
"<https://github.com/yuanming-"
"hu/taichi/blob/master/examples/mpm_lagrangian_forces.py>`_ for this."

"**Does the compiler backend support the same quality of optimizations for"
" the GPU and CPU? For instance, if I switch to using the CUDA backend, do"
" I lose the cool hash-table optimizations?** Mostly. The CPU/GPU "
"compilation workflow are basically the same, except for vectorization on "
"SIMD CPUs. You still have the hash table optimization on GPUs."
