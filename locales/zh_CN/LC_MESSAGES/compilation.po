"When the ``ti.kernel`` decorator is executed, a kernel named ``add`` is "
"registered. Specifically, the Python Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the "
"``add`` function will be memorized. No compilation will happen until the "
"first invocation of ``add``."

#: ../../compilation.rst:70
msgid ""
"**Template signatures** are what distinguish different instantiations of "
"a kernel template. The signature of ``add(x, 42)`` is ``(x, ti.i32)``, "
"which is the same as that of ``add(x, 1)``. Therefore, the latter can "
"reuse the previously compiled binary. The signature of ``add(y, 42)`` is "
"``(y, ti.i32)``, a different value from the previous signature, therefore"
" a new instantiation and compilation will happen."

"Many basic operations in the Taichi standard library is implemented using"

"Examples include ``x.to_numpy()`` and ``y.from_torch(torch_tensor)``. "
"When you invoke these functions, you will see kernel instantiations, as "
