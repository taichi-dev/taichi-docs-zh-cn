"When running the CUDA backend on Windows and ARM devices (e.g. NVIDIA "

"You can override this by initializing with ``ti.init(arch=ti.cuda, "

"Computation happens within Taichi **kernels**. Kernel arguments must be "

"parallel, and differentiable**."

"**Struct-for loops** have a cleaner syntax, and are particularly useful "
